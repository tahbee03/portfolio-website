## Description
As an effort to showcase a fraction of my life in a creative way, I have 
created this portfolio website. This website presents my career goals, my 
experience up until this point, Mini Comics that I have created in my spare 
time, and so much more! Not only was this website a great opportunity to 
share select aspects of my life, but it was also a good opportunity to 
enhance my web development skills since I incorporated tools like HTML, CSS, 
and Google Cloud.

## Development Process
1. Brainstormed the key components of the website
2. Used Flask to set up the routing for each of the pages
3. Used HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to design the structure and styling of each page
4. Used JavaScript to help with animations and event handling
5. Set up a project in Google Cloud and used the Cloud Run service to containerize and deploy the website
